                  generator for Java programs which is named
                  EvoSuite. The salient features of EvoSuite include
                  1) test suite generation based on evolutionary
                  algorithms and 2) mutation-based assertion
                  generation. The search based test suite generation
                  focuses on an entire coverage criterion, intead of
                  individual coverage goals. It can achieve higher
                  coverage than other search based techniques in
                  general. The assertion generation is an
                  implementation of the approach described in the
                  author's ISSTA 2010 and TSE 2012 papers. With a kind
                  of reduction, it can kill a large portion of mutants
                  with a relatively small number of assertions.}

                  Randoop. The core part of Randoop is a feedback
                  directed random test geneartion technique. Randoop
                  checks a group of default (implicit) contrast in
                  Java and .NET, including the properties of the
                  equals() methods and the absence of some runtime
                  exceptions. Moreover, Randoop optionally check the
                  consistency of behaviors of different versions of
                  the same APIs. Randoop uses several heuristic rules
                  to identify observer methods, records their
                  behaviors on specific inputs, and then uses the
                  recorded behaviors as regression oracles. },

 The analysis of so efficiency is based on the time needed to reach a certain confidence level on the SUT and on discoverinf a max number of faults in a give time.
 The analysis show that there is maximum analysis cost after which RT is more efficient than so. Since the cost is related to the size of the SUT this implies that there is a maximum program size for systematic techniques.},
